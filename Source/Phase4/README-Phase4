Phase 4 includes software tools for ScRNA-seq dataset integration, dimensionality reduction, 
cell clustering, and cell annotation based on gene markers and gene expression profiles.
 
In this phase, of the case study, we use the following tools: Seurat package for data integration, 
dimensionality reduction, and cell clustering. In contrast, Cellassign (version 0.99.21) and ScType 
to identify the cell type based on a predefined set of gene markers. 

Seurat carries out the clustering through a graph-based approach on a PCA reduction with several dozens 
of PCs (typically >= 30). Based on the Euclidean distance in the PCA space, we first construct a KNN graph 
then used the Louvain algorithm to cluster the cells. Finally, we use the UMAP algorithm for cluster 
visualization, with the PCA reduction as input.

In Phase 4, we group samples depending on level of the severity. Therefore, there are three groups of 
integrated samples: control, mild and severe, with specific scripts for each group. Phase 4 scripts 
require a submission queue to nodes with 768 GB RAM. Groups can be processed concurrently.
