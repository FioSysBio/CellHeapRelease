In Phase 3, CellHeap used R (v.4.2.1), an integrated suite of software facilities for data 
manipulation, calculation, and graphical display that is highly extensible. 
Many packages are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites providing a wide variety 
of statistical and graphical routines. CRAN is a network of FTP and worldwide web servers that 
stores identical, up-to-date code and documentation versions for R, in https://cran.r-project.org/. 

CellHeap performs data quality control by filtering cells. First, we use the SoupX package 
v.1.6.2 to estimate ambient RNA contamination. Then, we use the Seurat package to filter cells 
by removing cell barcodes according to the three criteria commonly used for scRNA-Seq quality 
control processing: UMI counts; genes expressed per cell; and percentage of mitochondrial DNA. 
The filtering parameters must be refined based on the tissue and the scientific question under 
investigation. After filtering, we remove cells contaminated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and use 
only non-contaminated cells in the downstream analysis.
