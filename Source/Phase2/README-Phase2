In Phase 2, Cellheap uses Cellranger count (v.6.1.0) to align reads to a reference genome for each sample's file. 
Cellranger count processes scRNA-Seq data and generates the gene-barcode matrix, demanding a large amount of storage 
and processing capacity. This task produces several output files, of which the barcodes.tsv, matrix.mtx, and 
features.tsv, the input files for Phase 3, are the most representative. The output datasets generated by Cellranger 
count also provide quality assessment reports that display essential quality metrics (i.e., Q30).

In Phase 2, the appropriate use of available computing power is crucial to efficiently execute our scRNA-Seq workflow 
with COVID-19 data. This phase also requires submission queues that have computing nodes with 768 GB RAM.

We assembles a hybrid reference genome to align reads for the case study. The assembly of the hybrid genome is executed 
only once by invoking the Cellranger mkref function, which includes both the human genome (GRCh38 v3.0.0) and the 
SARS-CoV-2 genome (NC_045512v2) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate genome Wuhan-Hu-1. 
The reference genome is built offline and is an input parameter for Cellranger count.
